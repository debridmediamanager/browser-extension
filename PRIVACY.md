# Privacy Policy — Debrid Media Manager Browser Extension

**Last updated:** 2026-02-09

## Data Collection

This extension does **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal data.

## How It Works

- The extension runs entirely locally in your browser.
- It reads page content on supported sites (IMDB, MDBList, TraktTV, iCheckMovies, Letterboxd, JustWatch, TheTVDB, Criticker, Metacritic) solely to extract title identifiers and add DMM buttons.
- It detects magnet links on any page to add DMM buttons beside them.
- No data is sent to any server. Clicking a DMM button opens a new tab to debridmediamanager.com with the title ID or magnet hash in the URL.

## Permissions

- **Host permission (`<all_urls>`)**: Required to detect magnet links on any website. On supported sites, it reads the page to extract IMDB IDs.

## Third Parties

This extension does not use analytics, tracking, or any third-party services.
